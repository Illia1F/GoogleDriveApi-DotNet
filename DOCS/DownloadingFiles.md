# Downloading Files from Google Drive

This document provides an overview of the downloading feature in this library that interacts with the Google Drive API.

## Overview

The feature is designed to handle both standard files and Google-specific MIME types (like Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings) by exporting them to compatible formats before downloading.

## Methods

### DownloadFileAsync

Downloads a file from Google Drive by its file ID.

**Parameters:**
- `fileId`: The ID of the file to download.
- `saveToPath`: The local path where the file will be saved (default is "Downloads").

**Process:**
1. Refreshes the authentication token if necessary.
2. Ensures the destination directory exists.
3. Fetches the file metadata using the file ID.
4. Determines if the file has a Google-specific MIME type.
5. If the file has a Google-specific MIME type, the MIME type is converted to an exportable type.
6. Constructs the full path for the downloaded file.
7. If the file is a Google-specific MIME type, it is exported; otherwise, it is downloaded as a binary file.

## Handling Google-Specific MIME Types

Google-specific MIME types represent Google Workspace files, such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Drawings. 
These MIME types are not directly downloadable as standard file formats. 
Instead, they need to be exported to a compatible MIME type for downloading.

## Why Export Files with Google-Specific MIME Types
When encountering a Google-specific MIME type, it's necessary to export the file to a standard format because these files are not stored in a traditional binary format. 
Exporting allows the file to be transformed into a universally recognized format, enabling it to be saved, opened, and edited with standard software outside of the Google Workspace environment. 
This step ensures compatibility and usability of the downloaded file across different platforms and applications.
